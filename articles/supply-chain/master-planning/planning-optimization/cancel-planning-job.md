# Cancel a planning job

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, you can cancel an active planning job that uses the Planning Optimization functionality. It is important to notice that selecting Cancel, in the pop-up window shown when a Planning Optimization job is triggered directly from the UI (if not run in the background), will not cancel the Planning optimization job. The notification might say 'Operation canceled', but you still need to follow the below steps to cancel the planning job with Planning optimization.

To cancel an active planning job, follow these steps. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only active jobs can be canceled.

1. Go to **Master planning \> Setup \> Plans**.
2. Select an appropriate plan for the planning run.
3. Select **History**.
4. Select the planning job to cancel.
5. Select **Cancel**.

The job status will be **Canceling** until the Planning Optimization service confirms that the job has been canceled. The status will then be changed to **Canceled**.

> [!NOTE]
> To see status changes, you must refresh the page by selecting the **Refresh** button.
